## What are RNGs

Random number generators are essential in many types of programs.
Their uses range from security token generation to deciding what random
virtual items will drop in video games. Random number generators (RNGs) are needed
because the silicon circuits at the core of all computers are mostly deterministic by design.

This is a good thing. If this were not the case a program might act differently
when it is being used by an end user then when a programmer created it.

RNGs are an escape hatch from this determinism. They take entropy from some source
and use it to select a value from a given range (there will more on entropy later).
